- Source Data for Figure 4: multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetique tree for IleRS and AsnRS
- Source Data for Table 1: MNP and FCM (TOO COME SOON)
- Source Data for Figure 3: multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetique tree for
  * NCLDVs 5 core genes tree (NCLDV_5coreGenes.msa.fasta)
  * cellular and NCLDV RPB2 (TOO BE ADDED SOON)
- Genome sequence and CDS (fasta, faa and fnn files)
- Gene annotation table (Excel file)
